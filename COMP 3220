# Principles-of-Programming-Languages-COMP-3220
Principles of Programming Languages (COMP 3220) aims to introduce key constructs of programming languages as well as contrast key strengths and weaknesses in different programming languages, past and present. Students are introduced to various programming languages and will demonstrate an understanding of concepts presented in class by writing programs in these languages. Lastly, students will touch on the theory behind how programming languages are created and will be introduced to compiler design by studying different approaches to lexical and syntactic analysis. 

Students will leave with familiarity on the history of programming languages and how they were developed; be able to critically evaluate a given programming language to determine whether or not it is suitable for a given task; quickly pick up a new programming language and be able to write a simple program in it; be able to form a basic grammar for a language and parse an example of a program written in that grammar.
