# Objective

This program has two objectives. The first objective is to create a procedure that will take plaintext
and an encryption key, use the Vigenère cipher, and encrypt the plaintext. The second objective is to
create a procedure that will take cypher-text, an encryption key, use the Vigenère cipher, and
decrypt the cypher-text.
