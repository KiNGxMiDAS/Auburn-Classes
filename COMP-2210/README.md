# Data Structures and Algorithms
Fundamentals of Computing II (COMP 2210) is designed to introduce fundamental data structures and associated algorithms, as well as applications in which they are commonly used. An object-oriented approach to problem solving and program design will be emphasized in the lecture and reinforced in the lab. This is one of the cornerstone courses for several majors, including Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering. In this course, students will learn about developing programs that use data structures and collections to efficiently store data. Emphasis will be placed on the interplay between effective data structures and efficient algorithms.

By the end of this course, students will have learned how to:

* Create, verify, and assess computational solutions in Java.
* Create, verify, and assess software components that are expressed at a high level of abstraction.
* Apply standard problem-solving strategies in the creation of solutions.
* Demonstrate the behavior of standard collections and data structures.
* Analyze and assess standard collections and data structures with respect to efficiency and use case.
* Apply standard collections, data structures, and associated algorithms in the creation of solutions.
* Assess algorithms and software components with respect to time complexity.
