# Synchronisation Mechanisms

## Objectives:
* To implement the lock mechanism
* To implement condition variables
* To improve your source code reading skills
* To strengthen your debugging skill

We learned how to implement basic synchronisation mechanisms covered in our lectures. Specifically, you will design and implement synchronization primitives for the OS/161. You also will apply your newly implemented mechanisms to solve a synchronization problem in the next project (i.e., Project 4). On completion of this programming project, you are expected to demonstrate an ability to develop lock and CV mechanisms supporting concurrent programs.
You have to be familiar with the OS/161 thread code in order to accomplish this project. Note that the thread system is comprised of interrupts, control functions, and semaphores. Please keep in mind that the goal of this project is to implement locks and condition variables.
