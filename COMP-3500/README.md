# Introduction to Operating Systems

# Objectives
Introduction to Operating Systems (COMP 3500) teaches the structure and functions of operating systems; processes and process scheduling; synchronization and mutual exclusion; memory management; auxiliary storage management; resource allocation and deadlock; security, privacy, and ethical concerns; design tradeoffs.

This course aims to:
* educate students on the fundamental concepts and components of operating systems;
* introduce the characteristics of hardware related to operating systems; and
* present the good tradeoffs among objectives conflicting with one another.

On completion of the course, students should be able to:
* Understand the essential concepts and mechanisms of operating systems;
* Implement a synchronization mechanism;
* Build system calls;
* Know the paging and TLB technologies;
* Construct a virtual memory management system;
* Understand file management strategies;
* Evaluate operating system performance; and
* Demonstrate ability to program at low levels.
