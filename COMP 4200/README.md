# Formal Languages

# Objectives
Formal Languages (COMP 4200) teaches the dundamentals of formal languages including mathematical models of regular sets, context-free languages and Turing machines; deterministic and non-deterministic models.

This course aims to:
* educate students on the fundamental concepts and components of operating systems;
* introduce the characteristics of hardware related to operating systems; and
* present the good tradeoffs among objectives conflicting with one another.

On completion of the course, students should be able to:
* Understand mathematical and formal methods of computer science.
* Understand classes of abstract languages, their boundaries, and their representations both in terms of grammar and machine models.
* Understand the significance of formal languages for computer science in general.
