# Software-Construction

# Objectives
Software Construction (COMP 2710) is both a course on managing the complexity of large systems and an applied programming class. Managing software complexity requires some knowledge of software process. Applied programming means that you will be required to critically analyze real-world types of problems, design algorithms, and then implement those algorithms in high-level code to solve problems.

Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:
1. Grasp both C++ Syntax and Semantics such as pointers 
2. Develop software on Linux
3. Use assertions and design by contract to develop high-reliability programs
4. Understand concepts of data abstraction, efficiency, and memory management
5. Understand how to perform unit and system-level testing
6. Apply recursion to solve problems
7. Understand concurrency programming
8. Understand how to avoid deadlocks in programming 

# Project Overview
## Project 1
A flow of control program that determines how many months it will take to pay of a loan given the loan amount and the interest rate.

## Project 2
Given three "players", the program will determine the winner of a duel between them based on individual probablities of a player landing a hit on another.

## Project 3
Program merges two lists from files and sorts them in numerical order. Program will then export the final sorted list into an output with the name of choice chosen by the user.

## Project 4
An implementation of a simple trivia game. It allows the user to come up with their questions and answers and can assigned points depending on the difficulty of the question. Players can win points by answering the questions correctly. Lastly, the program is organized and managed using a linked data structure.

## Project 5
Program is designed to simulate the producer/consumer problem -- (concurrency). The idea behind the project is to familiarise oneself with the basics of the POSIX thread library.
