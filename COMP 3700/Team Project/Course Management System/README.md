# Course Management System 

As the name suggests, this course management system is an online management software application designed for educational institutions. The primary goal of the project is to facilitate seamless interaction between students and instructors in schools, colleges, and universities concerning the submission of projects, assignments, thesis, and receiving feedback from instructors. 

This project has three interlinked modules: 

* Administrator module – This module is designed exclusively for managing administrative functions like creating accounts for students and instructors, creating the curriculum, coding the subjects, managing the employees, payroll, and so on. Basically, this module lays the groundwork for the other two modules. 

* Students module – This module is designed for the usage of students. They can log in to their accounts to view their coursework, submit their projects, get feedback from instructors, etc.

* Instructor module – This module is for the instructors who can log in to their accounts and check the projects submitted by the students, communicate with the students, and offer guidance to them.


# Software Modeling and Design

# Objectives
Software Modeling and Design (COMP 3700) aims to educate students on the role of analysis and design in the software engineering lifecycle, develop object-oriented designs by applying established design principles, develop use-case and scenario descriptions of the requirements, develop richer descriptions of design models using UML diagrams, understand the role and influence of design patterns and frameworks in software design, and evaluate the quality of design models.

Students will be able to:
* Understand the role of analysis and design in the software engineering lifecycle.
* Develop object-oriented designs by applying established design principles.
* Develop use-case and scenario descriptions of the requirements.
* Develop richer descriptions of design models using UML diagrams.
* Understand the role and influence of design patterns and frameworks in software design.•Evaluate the quality of design models.
