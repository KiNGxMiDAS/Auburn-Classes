Course management system: As the name suggests, this course management system is an online management software application designed for educational institutions. The primary goal of the project is to facilitate seamless interaction between students and instructors in schools, colleges, and universities concerning the submission of projects, assignments, thesis, and receiving feedback from instructors. This project has three interlinked modules: • Administrator module – This module is designed exclusively for managing administrative functions like creating accounts for students and instructors, creating the curriculum, coding the subjects, managing the employees, payroll, and so on. Basically, this module lays the groundwork for the other two modules. • Students module – This module is designed for the usage of students. They can log in to their accounts to view their coursework, submit their projects, get feedback from instructors, etc. • Instructor module – This module is for the instructors who can log in to their accounts and check the projects submitted by the students, communicate with the students, and offer guidance to them.
