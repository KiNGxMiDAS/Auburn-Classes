# Data Structures and Algorithms
Fundamentals of Computing II (COMP 2210) is designed to introduce fundamental data structures and associated algorithms, as well as applications in which they are commonly used. An object-oriented approach to problem solving and program design will be emphasized in the lecture and reinforced in the lab.
